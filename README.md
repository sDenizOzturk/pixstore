<p align="center"><em>TypeScript Full Stack Image Storage & Caching Library</em></p>

**Pixstore** is a modern, high-performance, and fully secure image storage and caching library for both Node.js backends and browser frontends. It is written in **vanilla TypeScript** with zero external frameworks or heavy dependencies.

Pixstore enables **end-to-end encrypted**, reliable, and scalable image serving for any web app — from simple JavaScript projects to full-stack production systems.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Automatic browser caching:** Transparent IndexedDB cache with token-based invalidation and eviction.
- **End-to-end encryption:** All images are AES-GCM encrypted, with a unique key per image. Keys never leave the backend by default.
- **Minimal wire protocol:** Efficient, protocol-agnostic binary wire format for image transfer.
- **Stateless secure endpoints:** All access is protected by a stateless, time-based proof and per-image tokens. Default endpoint is now secure-by-default.
- **High performance backend:** Uses SQLite for fast, reliable metadata storage and cache.
- **Production-ready:** Includes comprehensive tests and example apps (Vue+Nest, React+Express).
- **Fully extensible:** Supports custom endpoints and image fetchers for advanced integrations.
- **Minimal dependencies:** Lightweight and easy to audit.
- **TypeScript native:** Full typesafety and strict API design.
- **Universal API:** The same methods and types for both frontend and backend.
